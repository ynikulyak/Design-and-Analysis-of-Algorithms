# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms

This class was taken during my study at California State University Monterey Bay to complete my Bachelor Degree in computer Science.

The course teaches the important data structures in computer science in C++ language and acquire fundamental algorithm design techniques to get the efficient solutions to several computing problems from various disciplines. Topics include the analysis of algorithm efficiency, hash, heap, graph, tree, sorting and searching, brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-and-conquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy programming.

The main covered topics were:

###1. Graphs

    Depth-first-search
     Breadth-first-search
     Graph representation (adjacency matrix, adjacency list)
    Directed/undirected, weighted, connected, acyclic
	
###2. Analysis of algorithm efficiency:
     Big-Oh (O) Notation 
     Big-Theta ( Θ ) Notation 
     Big-Omega ( Ω ) 
     Master Theorem

###3. Trees and heap

     Binary tree
     Binary Search Tree
          pre-order traversal
          in-order traversal
